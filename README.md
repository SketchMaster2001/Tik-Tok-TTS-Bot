# TikTok-TTS-Bot
A simple Discord Bot that converts text to voice using TikTok's TTS API

## What does this bot do?
This bot converts text into speech using TikTok's TTS API. The reason behind using TikTok's API is because of the many funny voices there are. ~~It is also free~~

If you ever wanted C-3PO to say `I love the Empire` within Discord, now you can!
